# Characterization-of-Alibaba-traces
Computing reuse distance of some Alibaba traces.
# Algorithm
We developed an algorithm based on AVL tree as mentioned in lecture30.pdf to compute reuse distance of four Alibaba traces in $O(nlogn)$ time and $O(n)$ space.
Our cpp code is ReuseDistance.cpp.
# Results
Results are available in Images folder.
